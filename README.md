# MongoDB Schema Models

This repository contains MongoDB schema models for three different applications: hospital management, e-commerce, and a to-do app. These schema models are designed to be used as a reference or starting point for similar projects.

## Hospital Management

The hospital management schema model includes collections for patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records. Each collection is designed to store relevant information for managing a hospital's operations.

## E-commerce

The e-commerce schema model includes collections for products, categories, orders, and customers. It is designed to support an e-commerce platform's functionality, such as product listings, order processing, and customer management.

## To-Do App

The to-do app schema model includes a collection for tasks. Each task document includes fields for the task's title, description, due date, and status. This schema model is designed for a simple to-do list application.

## Usage

To use these schema models, simply import them into your MongoDB database using a tool like `mongoimport` or use them as a reference when designing your own schema models.
